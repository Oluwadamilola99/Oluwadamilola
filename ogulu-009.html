<p>If Jesus had told the woman caught in the very act of adultery, "go thy way.." The RELIGIOUS ones would have frown at him and accused Him of not being faithful and committed to them that have never done that before

If Jesus had accused the woman and said, "for doing this, you are condemned forever." The 'NOMINAL SPIRITUAL ONES' would have got upset and considered Jesus not a saviour. For why will a Saviour condemned one of those He came to save?

Jesus stooped low and did as if He heard them not...He kept quiet...</p>

Quick to hear and slow to respond.... Perhaps Jesus has travelled far in the spirit to bring forth word of wisdom that would be an answer to both the religious and the nominal spiritual ones'. 

Jesus simply left them to be convicted by their own conscience

I condemn you not, go and sin no more, Sister and brother

Yes, you are caught in the act.... But those are the words the Saviour said.

Or, you want to stay there and wallow in your sin?

Nay, GO AND SIN NO MORE

You shouldn't continue because you did it once, twice or thrice

Rise and be helped

<p>Whenever you hold mic to sing or preach of teach, those that have caught you in the act, signal to you to take it easy because they know you too well</p>

And then, you are now depressed

Sin no more is the instruction

And you can't even do it by yourself

You need to be helped by the Spirit

And that should be your focus

You are useful

You're worthy to be used

You are loved by God

He condemns you not

Leave the religious ones out of the matter

And rest on the chest of the Most High

Forget those that said you can continue in the act  and that you don't need help

And, rely on the Spirit to help you even as You grow in His presence

Go and sin no more..
